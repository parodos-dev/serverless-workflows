# These are Tekton bundles containing custom tasks that we want EC to permit.
# The format is what EC uses to determine what tasks are considered trusted.
#
# I'm creating these manually now, but ideally there should be some CI
# triggered by whatever does the tkn bundle push to keep this data fresh.
