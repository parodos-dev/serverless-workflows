# notifications-openapi.yaml

This file is self-maintained based on the API defined (but not declared by a spec) in [notifications-backend plugin](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/notifications-backend/src/service/router.ts) from Backstage project.

The current version of the notifications OpenAPI includes only a subset (or more like a single API), which is the minimal required for the workflows for sending notifications.

We hold our hopes that one day, this can be standardized and be imported directly from its origin.

The single API is somewhat documented and the following content was generated by openapi-generator using:

```bash
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i /local/notifications-openapi.yaml -g markdown -o /local/notifications-docs
```
